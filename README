[deprecated]

Simple CMS (actually CMF) for sites without high traffic
(3 sites on zame cms, each with 5k-10k pageviews per day feels good
at low-end VPS: 0.1% cpu load, 200mb used memory, lighty as web server).

Currently there is no any examples or documentation, sorry.

Obliviously, refactoring required. Things to do:

* Re-create s-js from scratch: use selectors instead of node.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode
* Use ajax in admin (instead of iframe)
* Admin interface for mobile phones
* More form elements
